## List.h
- This is the header file which contains all the functions that I am writing in the List.cpp ADT file.
-It contains declarations for the constructors, destructors, manipulation functions, access functions, and the other functions. 

## List.cpp
- This file is where I wrote all the functions for the List ADT, and I updated it from pa1 to a new cursor system. 

## ListTest.cpp
- This file is where I tested all the List ADT functions. 

## Shuffle.cpp
- This is the client function which takes in an integer, and then prints a table with the amount of times to shuffle before reverting to its original state. 
- I made a helper function called shuffle which did the actual shuffle process, and then used it in a loop in main. 

## Makefile
- This is where I created the executables for ListTest and Shuffle.
