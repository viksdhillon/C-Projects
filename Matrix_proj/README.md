## List.h
- This is the header file which contains all the functions that I am writing in the List.cpp ADT file.
-It contains declarations for the constructors, destructors, manipulation functions, access functions, and the other functions. 

## List.cpp
- This file is where I wrote all the functions for the List ADT, and I updated it from pa5 to a long for list element.

## ListTest.cpp
- This file is where I tested all the List ADT functions. 

## Arithmetic.cpp
- This is the client function which does simple functions on the big integer ADT, like add, sub, mult. 

## Makefile
- This is where I created the executables for BigIntegerTest and Arithmetic. 

## BigInteger.cpp
- This is where I wrote the BigInteger ADT. I implemented, constructors, to_string, add, mult, sub, and helper functions like sumList and normalizeList. 

## BigInteger.h
- This is the header file for the BigInteger class, and I declared all the functions in here, except for the local functions to BigInteger.cpp

## BigIntegerTest.cpp
- This is where I tested the functions in the BigInteger ADT.
