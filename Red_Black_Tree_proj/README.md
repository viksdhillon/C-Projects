## Dictionary.h
- This is the header file which contains all the functions that I am writing in the Dictionary.cpp ADT file.
-It contains declarations for the constructors, destructors, manipulation functions, access functions, and the other functions. 

## Dictionary.cpp
- This file is where I wrote all the functions for the Dictionary ADT, including SetValue and Remove and RBT helpers.

## DictionaryTest.cpp
- This file is where I tested all the Dictionary ADT functions for RBT implemented Dictionary ADT. 

## Order.cpp
- This is the client function which adds keys to a dictionary and prints out the key value pairs, and keys. 

## Makefile
- This is where I created the executables for DictionaryTest and Order and WordFrequency

## WordFrequency.cpp
- This is the client file that prints the frequencies of each word from the dictionary. It reads a text file and strips out the words, makes them lower case, and adds them.
